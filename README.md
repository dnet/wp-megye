Parser for Hungarian county list of Wikipedia
=============================================

Wikipedia [has a list of Hungarian cities][1], and this library parses it
into city -> county tuples or dictionary.

generator module
----------------

The following functions of the `generator` module can be used to parse the input.

   - `generate_items` is a generator and yields `(city, county)` tuples
   - `generate_dict` returns a city -> county dictionary
   - `generate_pickled` saves such a dictionary into a [Pickle][2] file

The `generator` module can also be called from the command line with a file
argument, as it can be seen in the following example.

	$ python generator.py output.pickle

lookup module
-------------

The `lookup` modules has a `Lookup` class, which can be instantiated with a
string parameter having the name of a Pickle file generated by `generator`.
The `get` method can be used to get the county associated with a certain
city. The `lookup` module can also be called from the command line with
two arguments as it can be seen in the following example.

	$ python lookup.py test.pickle Budapest
	Budapest
